                                     ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE(AI)                                    CHAPTER 1-Introduction to AIArtificial Intelligence is an approach to make a computer, a robot, or a product to think how smarthuman think. AI is a study of how human brain think, learn, decide and work, when it tries to solveproblems. And finally this study outputs intelligent software systems.The aim of AI is to improve computer functions which are related to human knowledge, for example, reasoning, learning, andproblem-solving.The intelligence is intangible. It is composed of--Reasoning-Learning-Problem Solving-Perception-Linguistic IntelligenceThe objectives of AI research are reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, realization, and ability to move and manipulate objects. There are long-termgoals in the general intelligence sector.Applications of AI· Gaming − AI plays important role for machine to think of large number of possible positions based on deep knowledge in strategic games. for example, chess,river crossing, N-queens problems and etc.· Natural Language Processing − Interact with the computer that understands natural language spoken by humans.· Expert Systems − Machine or software provide explanation and advice to the users.· Vision Systems − Systems understand, explain, and describe visual input on the computer.· Speech Recognition − There are some AI based speech recognition systems have ability to hear and express as sentences and understand their meanings while a person talks to it. For example Siri and Google assistant.· Handwriting Recognition − The handwriting recognition software reads the text written on paper and recognize the shapes of the letters and convert it into editable text.· Intelligent Robots − Robots are able to perform the instructions given by a human.Need for Artificial Intelligence1.To create expert systems which exhibit intelligent behavior with the capability to learn, demonstrate, explain and advice its users.2.Helping machines find solutions to complex problems like humans do and applying them as algorithms in a computer-friendly manner.
